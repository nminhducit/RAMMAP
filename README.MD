## Support Services

This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services, and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

## Applicable Law

- **United States:** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
- **Outside the United States:** If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

## Legal Effect

This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if they do not permit it to do so.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. Sysinternals gives no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Sysinternals excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages

You can recover from Sysinternals and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, or incidental damages. This limitation applies to:

- Anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third-party Internet sites, or third-party programs.
- Claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Sysinternals knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
